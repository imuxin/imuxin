### Hi there 👋

- 📜 Blog: https://imuxin.github.io, it's being work in progress.
- 🌱 I'm currently leaning Rust, C++.
- 🤔 Since open source projects are springing up, as a human being with only a few decades life, we can not master all of them. I would say there must be some basic, shared and simple core thinkings or some theoretical methods. I will spend all my life on feagure out the essence of CS. I would start with research CS development history.

- 💡 Make a serial tutorial with topic build * to master a programming language. ⏳
- 💡 Build a `todo` command line tools to manage personal tasks. I would intergrate with [nullboard](https://github.com/apankrat/nullboard), because I like its simple design. ⏳
- 💡 Build a `gitQL` to help quick understand an unfamiliar project based on git source controll. And I would intergrate with [metabase](https://github.com/metabase/metabase). ⏳
